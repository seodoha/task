Since Vietnam’s opening of its legal market, foreign law firms are able to establish their local offices on their own. The vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, the capital of Vietnam, is also its heart of economic growth with exciting businesses with young energy.

In January 2017, Asian Legal Business (ALB), which is a renowned monthly legal magazine in the Asia-Pacific area, selected Yoon & Yang as an Emerging Market Expert, along with other global law firms, broadening its presence in Southeast Asia. ALB described Yoon & Yang as “one of the leading law firms in Southeast Asia where sharp growth in legal demand is being observed.” The International Tax Review (ITR), a global publication that ranks leading tax law firms, recognized Yoon & Yang as the “Tax Law Firm of the Year” in the category of leading tax law firms in Asia. As can be seen, Yoon & Yang is being recognized for its strength and competitiveness in international legal services.
